# Getting Started

- Please read the INSTRUCTIONS.md first

# Code and Design Decisions
- Implement as Grid to divide the section in 3 
- Used syled components instead html comp so can be named and styled speicific property line item  e.g.  Listed vs price vs Address
- Used template laterals for string so formatted version of string become easy
- separate out smaller compponent as functional component id different file e.g ( heading, homePropertyList, HomeProperty)

## Dependencies
Added the base64  defor basic auth
Adding Grid with styled components

## Rest API Notes
- Data does not come straight
- Date needs to derived
- Mapping is not provided either - it is good to save one's time
